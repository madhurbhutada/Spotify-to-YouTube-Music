# macOS Site-Packages - Setup Required

YTMUSICAPI PACKAGE GOES HERE

This folder should contain the ytmusicapi Python package and its dependencies.

## WHAT YOU NEED:

Place the ytmusicapi package in this folder structure:

macos/site-packages/
├── ytmusicapi/ <- Main package
│ ├── **init**.py
│ ├── ytmusic.py
│ └── ... (other files)
└── (other dependencies) <- Any packages ytmusicapi needs

## HOW TO GET IT:

Use pip (requires Python):

1. Open Terminal
2. Run: pip install ytmusicapi --target ./runtime_templates/macos/site-packages/
3. This will download and install ytmusicapi and all dependencies

If you have installed using pip, you likely have all the reuired dependencies.
Make sure to include all dependencies in this folder.

## TESTING:

To verify it's set up correctly:

1. Navigate to the sp-ytm-migrate root folder
2. Run in Terminal:
   ./runtime_templates/macos/python/bin/python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, './runtime_templates/macos/site-packages'); import ytmusicapi; print('OK')"

If you see "OK", it's working!
